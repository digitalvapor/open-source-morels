`Morels <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella>`_ (*Morchella*) are of the `Ascomycetes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascomycota>`_, the spore shooters. The spores are formed in sacs called `Asci <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascus>`_ (plural). This term comes from the greek word ἀσκός *askos* for "sac" or "wineskin".

To start off, we have two `species <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella#Species>`_ we are documenting, but there are more than 60 species of *Morchella* worldwide! [1]_

Yellow Morel
============

    `Morchella esculenta <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella_esculenta>`_ Fr. and related forms. Fruit body 5-15cm tall, a rounded to elongated sponge-like structure; the pits of the sponge are very irregular without sign of any vertical arrangement. Ridges are pallid at first, with pits dark smoky brown; as fruit bodymatures the cap flushes yellow-ochre to orange as a result of the mature spores. Stem 40-80 x 20-50mm, often enlarged-swollen at base, hollow; white to pale cream. Flesh crisp; white. Odor pleasant. Taste pleasant. Spores ellipsoid, smooth, 20-25 x 12-16µ. Deposit deepest ochre-orange. Habitat various, in old abandoned orchards, under dying or dead elms, gardens, roadsides, or chalk quarries. Found throughout North America. Season: April-May. **Edible-highly prized!** Comment: A case of lead poisoning has been reported due to eating repeated meals of this fungus collected in orchards where instensive spraying has occurred.

Black Morel
===========

    `Morchella elata <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella_elata>`_ Fr. Fruit body 5-10cm (2-4in) tall, the head ovoid to conical, tending to be completely conical as it dries; the fertile head is black or dark brown with vertical ribs, the pits are rather regular. Stem 40-100 x 15-50mm, base often swollen; white, staining a little brownish in age; coarsely granular. Flesh hollow. Odor pleasant. Taste pleasant. Spores elliptical, smooth, 20-28 x 12-15µ. Deposit cream. Habitat with conifers, epecially pine, and also with poplar. Found throughout North America, but especially Washington and Michigan. Season: April-May. **Edible-good, but only to be eaten cooked.** Some people seem to be allergic to all morels. Comment: This species is part of a complex that some mycologists split up into various species: *Morchella conica* Pers. has a more conical shape; *Morchella angusticeps* Pk. has a narrow head with fewer pits.
