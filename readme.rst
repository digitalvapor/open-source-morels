Open Source Morels
==================

A lab notebook describing the cultivation of morel mushrooms!

Wikipedia on `Morchella <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella>`_:

    Morchella, the true morels, is a genus of edible mushrooms closely related to anatomically simpler cup fungi. These distinctive mushrooms appear honeycomb-like in that the upper portion is composed of a network of ridges with pits between them. The ascocarps are prized by gourmet cooks, particularly for French cuisine. Commercial value aside, morels are hunted by thousands of people every year simply for their taste and the joy of the hunt.

Species
=======

To start off, we have two `species <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella#Species>`_ we are documenting, but there are more than 60 species of *Morchella* worldwide [#]_!

* *Morchella Esculenta*, `Yellow Morel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella_esculenta>`_
* *Morchella Elata Group*, `Black Morel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella_elata>`_

Donating
========

**If you donate a species, we will research, propagate, and document it. Any species is very appreciated.**

If you have a species you would like to donate, please do! Spore prints are recommended because they are the easiest and cheapest shipping-wise for you, but any form is appreciated.

What will we do with the spores? We will provide step by step cultivation instructions with the world! We like to do things research-grade, and will be very thorough in sharing any knowledge obtained. Everything will be open source. **If there is demand, we are open to the idea of creating a morel spore library that we can share with anyone for free.**
